## About Me

**Builder. Engineer. Problem-solver. Entreprenuer.**

I create scalable systems, automation tools, and AI-driven applications across cloud, backend, and full-stack development. I enjoy taking ambitious ideas and turning them into real products that work.

With a dual background in **Computer Science** and **Finance**, I bridge technical excellence with business value. Currently a **Junior Data Analyst** at Handshake AI, I'm simultaneously building and launching multiple products—from **MacroSnap AI** (fitness platform) to automated trading systems to various SaaS platforms and marketplaces.

Beyond my own ventures and projects, <a href="https://github.com/IdeaLab537" style="color: #0066cc; text-decoration: underline;">**IdeaLab**</a> is a collaborative innovation hub and community where students and junior developers work together on real products and platforms. It's a place for people with similar interests to come together—building together, learning together, networking, and participating in fun events and meetups, growing as a community—all while gaining hands-on experience and creating something meaningful.

Looking ahead, I dream of working at a hedge fund or starting my own—combining quantitative analysis, algorithmic trading, and machine learning with my finance background to build sophisticated trading systems and investment strategies.

## Technical Expertise

I specialize in **full-stack development** and **DevOps**, leveraging technologies like:
- **Languages**: Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Dart, Flutter
- **Data & ML**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, LangGraph
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS, GCP, Firebase, Docker, Podman, Nginx, Linux, KVM, Qemu
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite
- **Tools**: Git, Tableau, Selenium, APIs, Bloomberg Terminal

I'm particularly passionate about building systems that combine real-time data processing, machine learning, and intuitive user interfaces. Each project I build is an opportunity to solve a unique problem and push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.

## Education & Continuous Learning

I'm currently pursuing a **B.S. in Computer Science** at Western Governors University (Aug 2023 — Jan 2026), building upon my foundation in **Finance, Economics, and Statistics** from Louisiana State University. I hold several certifications including:

- **Amazon AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** - [View Credential](https://www.credly.com/badges/9ea47925-0510-4979-a0df-5ab3c82af9b5/linked_in_profile)
- **ITIL 4 Foundation** - [Verify Certificate](https://www.peoplecert.org/for-corporations/certificate-verification-service) [GR671654683DO]
- **LPI Linux Essentials** - [Verify Certificate](https://cs.lpi.org/caf/Xamman/certification/verify/LPI000611234/k5dm49xw2a) [k5dm49xw2a]
- **IBM DevOps and Software Engineering**
- **DataCamp Data Scientist Professional (Python)**
- **Web3 Software Development**
- **Bloomberg Terminal Certified**
- **FINRA - Securities Industry Essentials (SIE)**
- **CompTIA Security+** (In Progress)

## Philosophy & Approach

I believe in the power of **continuous learning** and **practical application**. I approach each project with curiosity and a commitment to excellence, thinking critically about both the technical implementation and the business value of every solution.

**Building and creating** is at the core of who I am. There's something incredibly satisfying about taking an idea from concept to reality—from the first line of code to seeing something work in production. This passion extends beyond just writing code; it's about understanding systems holistically, from the database to the user experience, from the API endpoints to the deployment pipeline.

My **entrepreneurial journey** has taught me resilience, resourcefulness, and the importance of wearing multiple hats. As a freelancer and co-founder, I've learned to be a developer, DevOps engineer, project manager, and business strategist—all while maintaining high standards for code quality and user experience.

Looking ahead, I dream of working at a hedge fund or starting my own one day—combining my technical skills in quantitative analysis, algorithmic trading, and machine learning with my finance background to build sophisticated trading systems and investment strategies. This vision drives my continuous learning in both technology and finance.

I'm bilingual (English and Spanish) and always excited to collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.
