## About Me

I'm a **Software Engineer** and **Entrepreneur** with a dual background in **Computer Science** and **Finance**. This unique combination allows me to approach technical challenges with both analytical rigor and business acumen.

What drives me is a deep **passion for technology and business**—from full-stack applications to machine learning models to products and businesses that serve real users. My **entrepreneurial spirit** has led me to co-found companies, work as a freelance engineer, and actively build and launch my own products. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between innovative technology and real-world business value.

Currently, I work as an **Junior Data Analyst** at Handshake AI, where I conduct multimodal data analysis to enhance the accuracy and safety of multimodal large language models.

Beyond my work, I'm actively building and launching multiple products and platforms. This includes **MacroSnap AI** (a fitness and nutrition platform), an **automated cryptocurrency trading system** with ML and reinforcement learning, and a **cross-platform IPTV and movie streaming application**. I'm also developing various SaaS platforms, marketplaces, and fintech solutions—from insurance comparison tools and logistics ecosystems to creator platforms and AI-powered applications. These projects reflect my passion for bringing ideas to life and seeing them serve real users.

Through <a href="https://github.com/IdeaLab537" style="color: #0066cc; text-decoration: underline;">**IdeaLab**</a>, my internal innovation hub, I'm helping students and junior developers gain real-world project experience by contributing to actual products and platforms. It's a collaborative space where developers work on real features, submit pull requests, and participate in professional workflows—giving them portfolio-quality experience while helping bring MVPs and new software ideas to life.

## Professional Journey

My career has been marked by a passion for solving complex problems through technology. As a **Freelance Full-Stack & DevOps Engineer**, I've managed the complete lifecycle of client projects—from requirements to deployment. I've independently handled DevOps, deploying applications on VPS using containerized environments and configuring infrastructure.

Previously, I co-founded **Ordaz Logistics LLC**, where I led web development and database architecture. My experience also includes serving as an **Investment Fund Manager** at LSU Investment Fund, where I contributed to significant growth in Assets Under Management and utilized Bloomberg terminal for equity research.

## Technical Expertise

I specialize in **full-stack development** and **DevOps**, leveraging technologies like:
- **Languages**: Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Dart, Flutter
- **Data & ML**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, LangGraph
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS, GCP, Firebase, Docker, Podman, Nginx, Linux, KVM, Qemu
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite
- **Tools**: Git, Tableau, Selenium, APIs, Bloomberg Terminal

I'm particularly passionate about building systems that combine real-time data processing, machine learning, and intuitive user interfaces. Each project I build is an opportunity to solve a unique problem and push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.

## Education & Continuous Learning

I'm currently pursuing a **B.S. in Computer Science** at Western Governors University (Aug 2023 — Jan 2026), building upon my foundation in **Finance, Economics, and Statistics** from Louisiana State University. I hold several certifications including:

- **Amazon AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** - [View Credential](https://www.credly.com/badges/9ea47925-0510-4979-a0df-5ab3c82af9b5/linked_in_profile)
- **ITIL 4 Foundation** - [Verify Certificate](https://www.peoplecert.org/for-corporations/certificate-verification-service) [GR671654683DO]
- **LPI Linux Essentials** - [Verify Certificate](https://cs.lpi.org/caf/Xamman/certification/verify/LPI000611234/k5dm49xw2a) [k5dm49xw2a]
- **IBM DevOps and Software Engineering**
- **DataCamp Data Scientist Professional (Python)**
- **Web3 Software Development**
- **Bloomberg Terminal Certified**
- **FINRA - Securities Industry Essentials (SIE)**
- **CompTIA Security+** (In Progress)

## Philosophy & Approach

I believe in the power of **continuous learning** and **practical application**. I approach each project with curiosity and a commitment to excellence, thinking critically about both the technical implementation and the business value of every solution.

**Building and creating** is at the core of who I am. There's something incredibly satisfying about taking an idea from concept to reality—from the first line of code to seeing something work in production. This passion extends beyond just writing code; it's about understanding systems holistically, from the database to the user experience, from the API endpoints to the deployment pipeline.

My **entrepreneurial journey** has taught me resilience, resourcefulness, and the importance of wearing multiple hats. As a freelancer and co-founder, I've learned to be a developer, DevOps engineer, project manager, and business strategist—all while maintaining high standards for code quality and user experience.

Looking ahead, I dream of working at a hedge fund or starting my own one day—combining my technical skills in quantitative analysis, algorithmic trading, and machine learning with my finance background to build sophisticated trading systems and investment strategies. This vision drives my continuous learning in both technology and finance.

I'm bilingual (English and Spanish) and always excited to collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.
