## Introduction

During my time at Louisiana State University, I had the incredible opportunity to serve as an Investment Fund Manager for the LSU Investment Fund—a student-managed investment fund that provides hands-on experience managing real capital. This role wasn't just academic; we were responsible for real money, real decisions, and real outcomes. The experience taught me invaluable lessons about equity research, portfolio management, and the importance of data-driven decision-making in finance.

## The Challenge: Growing Assets Under Management

When I joined the fund, we were managing approximately $3.6 million in assets. Our goal was clear: outperform the market while growing our assets under management (AUM). This required a combination of rigorous research, strategic thinking, and the ability to identify undervalued opportunities in the market.

## The Bloomberg Terminal: A Game-Changer

One of the most transformative aspects of this role was gaining access to and proficiency with the Bloomberg Terminal—the industry-standard platform used by professional traders, analysts, and portfolio managers worldwide. The terminal became my primary tool for:

- **Real-time market data**: Access to live pricing, trading volumes, and market movements
- **Equity research**: Comprehensive company financials, analyst reports, and industry comparisons
- **Technical analysis**: Charting tools and technical indicators to identify entry and exit points
- **News and analytics**: Breaking financial news and sentiment analysis
- **Portfolio analytics**: Performance attribution and risk analysis tools

## Alpha Generation Through Rigorous Research

The competitive edge in portfolio management comes from identifying market inefficiencies before they're priced in. My approach centered on developing a systematic research process that combined fundamental analysis, quantitative screening, and technical indicators to uncover mispriced securities.

### The Research Framework

1. **Quantitative Screening**: Using Bloomberg's screening tools to identify companies meeting specific criteria—valuation metrics, growth rates, profitability margins, and balance sheet strength. This systematic approach helped filter thousands of potential investments down to a focused watchlist.

2. **Deep Fundamental Analysis**: For each candidate, I conducted comprehensive due diligence:
   - Financial statement analysis and trend identification
   - Competitive positioning and market share dynamics
   - Management quality and capital allocation decisions
   - Industry structure and competitive moats
   - Cash flow generation and capital efficiency

3. **Valuation Modeling**: Building discounted cash flow (DCF) models, comparable company analysis, and precedent transaction analysis to establish intrinsic value ranges. I paid particular attention to scenario analysis—base case, bull case, and bear case—to understand the risk/reward profile.

4. **Technical and Sentiment Analysis**: While fundamentals drive long-term value, I incorporated technical analysis to optimize entry and exit timing. I also monitored sentiment indicators, analyst revisions, and insider trading activity to gauge market positioning.

5. **Risk Assessment and Portfolio Fit**: Every position was evaluated not just in isolation, but in the context of portfolio construction. I analyzed correlation, sector exposure, and how each position contributed to overall portfolio risk-adjusted returns.

### The Process in Practice

The video above captures one of many after-hours research sessions—a testament to the dedication required to stay ahead of the market. Markets don't stop when trading hours end, and neither did my research. Whether analyzing earnings calls from Asian markets, reviewing overnight news flow, or updating models with the latest data, the commitment to thorough analysis was non-negotiable.

This disciplined approach led to several successful recommendations that contributed meaningfully to the fund's alpha generation. Each investment thesis was documented, tracked, and refined based on new information—creating a feedback loop that improved decision-making over time.

## Results: 16.7% AUM Growth Through Alpha Generation

Through systematic stock selection, rigorous research, and disciplined portfolio management, I contributed to growing the fund's AUM from $3.6 million to $4.2 million—a **16.7% increase**. This performance wasn't achieved through market beta; it required generating alpha through:

- **Active stock selection**: Identifying mispriced securities through fundamental and quantitative analysis
- **Risk-adjusted positioning**: Constructing a portfolio that maximized Sharpe ratio and information ratio, not just absolute returns
- **Dynamic portfolio management**: Continuously monitoring positions, updating theses, and rebalancing based on changing fundamentals and market conditions
- **Capital efficiency**: Optimizing position sizing to balance conviction with portfolio risk constraints

## Outperforming the Russell 2000 Index

Our fund's performance **outperformed the Russell 2000 Index** during my tenure, demonstrating the ability to generate alpha in a competitive small-cap universe. This outperformance wasn't accidental—it resulted from:

- **Information edge**: Leveraging Bloomberg Terminal's comprehensive data and analytics to identify opportunities before they became consensus trades
- **Disciplined execution**: Maintaining conviction in positions during volatility while being quick to cut losses when theses broke down
- **Risk management**: Ensuring our outperformance came from skill, not excessive risk-taking—maintaining appropriate position sizes and sector diversification
- **Continuous improvement**: Learning from both winners and losers, refining the investment process, and adapting to changing market regimes

## Key Learnings

### 1. The Power of Professional Tools

Working with the Bloomberg Terminal gave me an appreciation for the tools that professional investors use daily. The depth of data, the speed of analysis, and the integration of multiple information sources create a significant advantage over retail investors.

### 2. Research-Driven Decision Making

Every investment decision was backed by rigorous research and documented analysis. Successful positions weren't based on speculation or tips—they resulted from hours of fundamental analysis, quantitative screening, and careful consideration of both upside potential and downside risks. This process-oriented approach ensures consistency and repeatability in alpha generation.

### 3. Real-World Application of Finance Theory

This experience bridged the gap between classroom learning and real-world application. Concepts like portfolio theory, risk management, and valuation models came alive when applied to real capital and real consequences.

### 4. Collaboration and Communication

Managing a fund requires collaboration with other analysts and portfolio managers. Presenting investment recommendations, defending positions, and incorporating feedback from peers were essential skills I developed.

### 5. Performance Under Pressure and Work Ethic

Managing real money creates real pressure, especially when positions move against you. The after-hours research sessions—captured in the video above—demonstrate the work ethic required to stay competitive. Markets are efficient, and generating alpha requires putting in the work when others aren't. This experience taught me to remain disciplined under pressure, stick to the process, and maintain analytical rigor even when emotions run high.

## Technical Skills Developed

- **Bloomberg Terminal mastery**: Advanced proficiency in equity research functions (FA, GP, DES), portfolio analytics (PORT), market data (FLDS), and screening tools (EQS). Ability to quickly navigate the platform to extract actionable insights.
- **Financial modeling**: Building sophisticated DCF models, LBO models, and comparable company analysis. Experience with scenario analysis, sensitivity tables, and Monte Carlo simulations for risk assessment.
- **Portfolio construction and optimization**: Understanding of modern portfolio theory, correlation analysis, factor exposure, and risk budgeting. Experience with portfolio optimization techniques to maximize risk-adjusted returns.
- **Quantitative analysis**: Using statistical methods, regression analysis, and factor models to identify alpha-generating opportunities. Experience with backtesting strategies and performance attribution analysis.
- **Risk management**: Understanding of VaR, CVaR, drawdown analysis, and stress testing. Ability to construct portfolios that balance return objectives with risk constraints.
- **Market microstructure**: Understanding of order flow, liquidity, and execution strategies to minimize transaction costs and market impact.
